# Free Spins Accumulated Multiplier Sync Fix

## Problem
During Free Spin Mode, some random multipliers were not being added to the accumulated multiplier UI display (x64 badge). The client was not syncing with the server's authoritative accumulated multiplier value.

## Root Cause
The server was correctly calculating and sending `accumulatedMultiplier` in the spin response, but the client was:
1. **Not reading** the `accumulatedMultiplier` field from the server response
2. **Calculating locally** by incrementing when shooting stars arrived
3. **Missing some increments** due to race conditions or timing issues

## Investigation Timeline

### What We Found
1. **Server-Side (Correct)**:
   - `freeSpinsEngine.js` lines 193-203: Server correctly accumulates multipliers during free spins
   - `gameEngine.js` line 545: Server sends `accumulatedMultiplier` in free spins feature data
   - `game.js` line 295: Server returns `accumulatedMultiplier` in spin response

2. **Client-Side (Broken)**:
   - `NetworkService.js` `extractFreeSpinsInfo()`: Was NOT extracting `accumulatedMultiplier` from server response
   - `GameScene.js` `processServerSpinResult()`: Was NOT reading server's accumulated multiplier
   - `GameScene.js` `playRandomMultiplierShootingStar()` line 1192: Client was trying to calculate locally

## Fix Applied

### 1. NetworkService.js - Extract Server's Accumulated Multiplier
**File**: `src/services/NetworkService.js`
**Function**: `extractFreeSpinsInfo()`
**Lines**: 1080-1081, 1095

```javascript
// CRITICAL: Extract server's accumulated multiplier (authoritative during free spins)
const accumulatedMultiplier = source?.accumulatedMultiplier ?? freeFeature?.multiplier ?? 1;

return {
    freeSpinsAwarded: awarded,
    freeSpinsTriggered: ...,
    freeSpinsRetriggered: ...,
    freeSpinsActive: ...,
    freeSpinsRemaining: remaining,
    freeSpinsEnded: !!ended,
    accumulatedMultiplier: accumulatedMultiplier  // Server-authoritative accumulated multiplier
};
```

**Effect**: Now the normalized response includes `accumulatedMultiplier` from the server.

### 2. GameScene.js - Apply Server's Accumulated Multiplier
**File**: `src/scenes/GameScene.js`
**Function**: `processServerSpinResult()`
**Lines**: 2536-2548

```javascript
// CRITICAL FIX: Update free spins accumulated multiplier from server (authoritative)
if (this.stateManager.freeSpinsData.active && typeof normalized.accumulatedMultiplier === 'number') {
    const serverMultiplier = normalized.accumulatedMultiplier;
    console.log(`ðŸŽ° FREE SPINS ACCUMULATED MULTIPLIER UPDATE:`, {
        clientBefore: this.stateManager.freeSpinsData.multiplierAccumulator,
        serverValue: serverMultiplier,
        updating: true
    });
    // Set client accumulator to match server's authoritative value
    this.stateManager.freeSpinsData.multiplierAccumulator = serverMultiplier;
    // Update UI to show correct accumulated multiplier
    this.uiManager.updateAccumulatedMultiplier Display();
}
```

**Effect**: After processing each server spin result during free spins, the client now syncs its accumulated multiplier to match the server's value.

### 3. GameScene.js - Sync on Reconnect/State Restore
**File**: `src/scenes/GameScene.js`
**Function**: `applyServerGameState()`
**Lines**: 2396-2400

```javascript
// CRITICAL: Sync accumulated multiplier from server
if (typeof gameState.accumulated_multiplier === 'number') {
    this.stateManager.freeSpinsData.multiplierAccumulator = gameState.accumulated_multiplier;
    console.log(`ðŸŽ° Synced free spins accumulated multiplier from server: x${gameState.accumulated_multiplier}`);
}
```

**Effect**: When reconnecting or restoring game state, the accumulated multiplier is also synced from the server.

## How It Works Now

### Server Flow (Unchanged)
1. Server generates random multipliers during free spins
2. Server accumulates: `session.accumulatedMultiplier += additionalMultiplier`
3. Server sends `accumulatedMultiplier: X` in response

### Client Flow (Fixed)
1. Client receives spin response with `accumulatedMultiplier: X`
2. NetworkService extracts it in `extractFreeSpinsInfo()`
3. GameScene reads `normalized.accumulatedMultiplier`
4. GameScene sets `this.stateManager.freeSpinsData.multiplierAccumulator = X`
5. UIManager updates the x64 badge display

## Expected Result
- **Before**: x64 badge sometimes showed x60 or x62 (missing some multipliers)
- **After**: x64 badge always shows the correct server-calculated total

## Testing
1. Enter Free Spins mode
2. Trigger random multipliers (x2, x5, x10, etc.)
3. Watch the x64 badge on the right side
4. Verify it increments correctly for EVERY multiplier event
5. Check browser console for log: `ðŸŽ° FREE SPINS ACCUMULATED MULTIPLIER UPDATE:`

## Benefits
âœ… **Server-Authoritative**: Client always displays server's calculated value
âœ… **No Race Conditions**: No timing issues with shooting star animations
âœ… **Reconnect-Safe**: Accumulated multiplier syncs on reconnect
âœ… **Consistent**: Client and server always agree on the value
