================================
  QUICK FIX - DO THIS NOW
================================

The 401 errors were caused by WRONG DATABASE CONFIG in .env!

✅ I FIXED IT - Database now points to correct Supabase (127.0.0.1:54322)
✅ SERVER RESTARTED with new config

================================
  WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
================================

1. CLEAR YOUR SESSION
   - Press F12 (open console)
   - Type: localStorage.clear()
   - Press Enter
   - Type: location.reload()
   - Press Enter

2. LOGIN AGAIN
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000/test-player-login.html
   - Click: "Login as Test Player"
   - Should see: ✅ Login Success!

3. PLAY GAME
   - Click: "→ Open Game"  
   - Play a spin
   - Balance should update! ✅

================================
  EXPECTED RESULT:
================================

BEFORE (broken):
- 401 errors ❌
- "Connection lost - switching to demo mode" ❌
- Balance doesn't update ❌

AFTER (fixed):
- No 401 errors ✅
- Server mode stays active ✅
- Balance updates after each spin ✅

================================

THAT'S IT! Just clear localStorage and login!
