# Formula Early Update Race Condition - FIXED

## Issue
The formula plaque's multiplier total was showing **inconsistently**:
- **Sometimes**: Formula appeared correctly after shooting stars fired
- **Most of the time**: Formula appeared immediately, before any shooting stars

This created a jarring visual experience where players saw the final result instantly instead of building up progressively.

## Root Cause
**Race Condition with `normalModePendingStars` Counter**

The counter was being incremented **inside delayed callbacks and async functions**, creating a timing gap where:

1. `showRandomMultiplierResult` sets `normalModePendingStars = 0` (line 515)
2. Events are processed, scheduling character animations
3. **RACE WINDOW**: `GameScene.updateWinDisplay()` is called (line 2623)
4. Check: `hasPendingStars = normalModePendingStars > 0` → **FALSE** (still 0!)
5. Formula shows immediately with full multiplier total ❌
6. Later: `showServerRandomMultiplierEntry` increments counter (line 652)
7. Later: Shooting stars fire (but formula already shown)

### Why It Was Inconsistent
- **Cascade events**: Line 689 pre-incremented by `positions.length` ✅
- **Single events**: Line 652 incremented inside async `showServerRandomMultiplierEntry` ❌
- If a spin had **only cascade multipliers** → formula waited (worked correctly)
- If a spin had **any single multipliers** → formula showed early (race condition)

## The Fix
**Pre-Count ALL Multipliers Before Processing ANY Events**

### File: `src/managers/BonusManager.js` (Lines 516-525)

```javascript
// CRITICAL: Pre-count total multipliers across ALL events BEFORE processing any events
// This prevents race condition where updateWinDisplay() sees 0 pending stars and shows formula too early
let totalMultiplierCount = 0;
events.forEach(rawEvent => {
    const normalized = this.normalizeServerMultiplierEvent(rawEvent);
    if (normalized && normalized.multipliers && normalized.multipliers.length > 0) {
        totalMultiplierCount += normalized.multipliers.length;
    }
});
this.scene.normalModePendingStars = totalMultiplierCount;
```

### Removed Redundant Increments
1. **Line 661**: Removed increment in `showServerRandomMultiplierEntry`
2. **Line 697**: Removed pre-increment in `showCascadingRandomMultipliers`

All increments are now replaced by a single, accurate pre-count.

## How It Works Now

### Timeline (Fixed)
1. `showRandomMultiplierResult` is called
2. **Immediately**: Count all multipliers across all events → `normalModePendingStars = N`
3. **Before any processing**: Counter is correct
4. `GameScene.updateWinDisplay()` checks `normalModePendingStars > 0` → **TRUE** ✅
5. Formula is **suppressed** (waits for stars)
6. Character animations play
7. Shooting stars fire, each one:
   - Increments `spinAccumulatedRM`
   - Updates formula display progressively
   - Decrements `normalModePendingStars`
8. When `normalModePendingStars === 0`: All stars arrived ✅
9. Final display is updated

## Expected Behavior
**100% Consistent Now**:
- Formula plaque shows **only the win amount** initially
- As each shooting star arrives at the plaque:
  - Multiplier text updates incrementally (x2 → x4 → x7, etc.)
  - Shooting star plays impact animation
  - Formula appears and pulses
- Player sees the multiplier **build up visually** with each star

## Testing
1. Spin until you get 2+ random multipliers
2. Observe:
   - ✅ No formula before stars fire
   - ✅ Formula appears as first star arrives
   - ✅ Formula updates progressively with each subsequent star
   - ✅ Final total matches server's value exactly

### Console Verification
Look for the log at the start of `showRandomMultiplierResult`:
```
📊 Server multiplier: x7 (from 2 events with 3 total multipliers, base: $0.90 → final: $6.30)
```

The counter should show the correct total **immediately** (e.g., "3 total multipliers").

## Files Modified
- `src/managers/BonusManager.js` (lines 516-525, 661, 697)

## Benefits
- ✅ **100% Consistent** - No more race condition
- ✅ **Progressive Visual Feedback** - Multipliers build up smoothly
- ✅ **Single Source of Truth** - One pre-count replaces multiple increments
- ✅ **Cleaner Code** - No redundant increment logic scattered across functions
- ✅ **Better Performance** - Counter set once instead of multiple async updates

---

**Result**: Formula plaque now **always** waits for shooting stars, creating a smooth, consistent, and engaging visual experience for all multiplier wins! 🎯⭐
