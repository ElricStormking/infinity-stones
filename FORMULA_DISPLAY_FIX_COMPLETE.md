# Formula Display Fix - Complete

## Issue
The formula plaque was showing `$5.90 x6 = $35.40` **immediately** when the spin result arrived, before any shooting star visuals played. This broke the progressive update experience.

## Root Cause
`UIManager.updateWinDisplay()` was called right after `showRandomMultiplierResult()` finished, and it was reading `scene.spinAppliedMultiplier` which had the full server total already set.

## Solution

### 1. Skip updateWinDisplay() when stars are pending
**File**: `src/scenes/GameScene.js` (lines 2607-2612)

Don't call `updateWinDisplay()` immediately after processing multipliers if there are pending shooting stars in normal mode:

```javascript
// In normal mode, if we have pending shooting stars, delay the win display update
// The stars will call updateWinDisplay progressively as they arrive
const hasPendingStars = !this.stateManager.freeSpinsData.active && (this.normalModePendingStars || 0) > 0;
if (!hasPendingStars) {
    this.updateWinDisplay();
}
```

This prevents showing `$0.90 x0 = $9.00` before any stars fire.

### 2. Call updateWinDisplay() after all stars complete
**File**: `src/scenes/GameScene.js` (line 1215)

After the last shooting star arrives, call `updateWinDisplay()` to finalize the formula:

```javascript
console.log(`✅ All normal mode shooting stars arrived! Final multiplier: x${this.spinAccumulatedRM}`);

// All stars done - ensure win display is finalized
this.updateWinDisplay();
```

### 3. Remove BonusManager updateWinDisplay() calls
**File**: `src/managers/BonusManager.js` (lines 104, 444, 558)

Removed ALL calls to `updateWinDisplay()` from BonusManager because they were happening AFTER character animations but BEFORE shooting stars fired:

```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN):
this.scene.updateWinDisplay(); // Called immediately after character animation!

// NEW (FIXED):
// NOTE: Do NOT call updateWinDisplay() here - let shooting stars handle progressive updates
```

This was the main cause - BonusManager was displaying the formula too early!

### 4. Changed UIManager to use progressive value
**File**: `src/managers/UIManager.js` (lines 1175-1185)

```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN):
mult = Math.max(1, this.scene.spinAppliedMultiplier || 1); // Full total!

// NEW (FIXED):
mult = Math.max(0, this.scene.spinAccumulatedRM !== undefined ? this.scene.spinAccumulatedRM : (this.scene.spinAppliedMultiplier || 1));
```

`spinAccumulatedRM` starts at 0 and increments as each star arrives.

### 5. Hide formula when stars are pending (UIManager fallback)
**File**: `src/managers/UIManager.js` (line 1184-1185)

```javascript
// Don't show formula until at least one star has arrived
const hasPendingStars = !inFreeSpins && (this.scene.normalModePendingStars || 0) > 0;
const meaningfulFormula = (baseRounded >= 0.01) && (multRounded >= 1.01) && !hasPendingStars;
```

This prevents showing `$5.90 x0 = $35.40` (mathematically wrong) and instead just shows `$35.40` until stars start arriving.

## Result
✅ **Correct Progressive Display Flow**:

1. **Initial**: NO display update (skipped because `normalModePendingStars > 0`)
2. **First star arrives**: `$5.90 x2 = $11.80` appears with pulse
3. **Second star arrives**: `$5.90 x4 = $23.60` updates with pulse  
4. **Third star arrives**: `$5.90 x6 = $35.40` final value with pulse
5. **All stars done**: `updateWinDisplay()` called to finalize, safety check verifies client matches server

The formula now updates **synchronously with each shooting star arrival**, creating a satisfying progressive reveal of the total multiplier.

## Files Changed
1. `src/scenes/GameScene.js` - Skip `updateWinDisplay()` when stars pending, call it after all stars complete
2. `src/managers/UIManager.js` - Use `spinAccumulatedRM`, hide formula when stars pending
3. `src/managers/BonusManager.js` - Removed all `updateWinDisplay()` calls (lines 104, 444, 558) to let shooting stars handle progressive updates

## Testing
Refresh browser and spin until you get random multipliers in normal mode. You should see:
- No formula initially (just win amount)
- Formula appears and increments as each star arrives
- Each arrival triggers a pulse animation
- Final value matches server's calculation
