# Formula Plaque - Progressive Calculation Fix

## Issue
The formula plaque was showing the **final total** ($16.90) immediately instead of progressively updating as each shooting star arrived.

**Example:**
- Server: x3 + x2 + x2 + x2 + x2 + x2 = x13 total
- Base win: $1.30
- Expected progression:
  1. Star 1 arrives: `$1.30 x3 = $3.90`
  2. Star 2 arrives: `$1.30 x5 = $6.50`
  3. Star 3 arrives: `$1.30 x7 = $9.10`
  4. ...
  5. Star 6 arrives: `$1.30 x13 = $16.90`

**What was happening:** 
- Star 1 arrives: `$1.30 x3 = $16.90` ‚ùå (showed final total immediately!)

## Root Cause

In `GameScene.js` line 1194-1195, the shooting star arrival handler was using `this.totalWin` (the final total) instead of calculating the progressive amount:

```javascript
// OLD (WRONG):
const shownFinal = this.totalWin;  // ‚Üê Always $16.90 (final total)
this.uiManager.setWinFormula(base, newMult, shownFinal);
// Result: "$1.30 x3 = $16.90" (wrong!)
```

This caused the formula to show the **final win amount** from the start, even though the multiplier was still accumulating.

## The Fix

**File**: `src/scenes/GameScene.js`

### Change 1: Progressive Calculation (Line 1194-1196)

```javascript
// NEW (FIXED):
const base = Math.max(0, this.baseWinForFormula || 0);
// Calculate progressive final amount based on CURRENT multiplier (not total win)
const shownFinal = base * newMult;  // ‚Üê Calculate from current multiplier!
this.uiManager.setWinFormula(base, newMult, shownFinal);
// Result: "$1.30 x3 = $3.90" (correct!)
```

### Change 2: Safety Check Correction (Line 1219-1220)

Also fixed the safety check that corrects multiplier mismatches:

```javascript
// NEW (FIXED):
this.spinAccumulatedRM = targetMult;
const correctedFinal = base * targetMult;  // ‚Üê Calculate from corrected multiplier
this.uiManager.setWinFormula(base, targetMult, correctedFinal);
```

## Expected Result

**Please refresh (F5)** and test again. The formula plaque should now:

### Visual Progression (Example: x13 from 6 stars)

1. **Before stars:** `$1.30` (base win only)
2. **Star 1 (x3) arrives:** `$1.30 x3 = $3.90`
3. **Star 2 (x2) arrives:** `$1.30 x5 = $6.50`
4. **Star 3 (x2) arrives:** `$1.30 x7 = $9.10`
5. **Star 4 (x2) arrives:** `$1.30 x9 = $11.70`
6. **Star 5 (x2) arrives:** `$1.30 x11 = $14.30`
7. **Star 6 (x2) arrives:** `$1.30 x13 = $16.90` ‚úÖ

### Console Output

You should see:
```
‚≠ê Normal mode shooting star arrived! Incrementing multiplier: x0 + x3 = x3
üîß setWinFormula called: x3 (5 stars pending)
‚≠ê Normal mode shooting star arrived! Incrementing multiplier: x3 + x2 = x5
üîß setWinFormula called: x5 (4 stars pending)
...
‚úÖ All normal mode shooting stars arrived! Final multiplier: x13
```

## Key Fix

**Before:** Formula showed `base √ó currentMult = TOTAL_WIN` (wrong - used pre-calculated total)
**After:** Formula shows `base √ó currentMult = (base √ó currentMult)` (correct - calculates from current multiplier)

The formula plaque now **progressively calculates** the win amount as each star arrives, instead of showing the final total from the beginning! üéØ
